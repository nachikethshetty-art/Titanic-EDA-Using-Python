# Titanic-EDA-Using-Python
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) performed on the Titanic dataset using Python to understand survival patterns, handle missing values, detect outliers, and visualize relationships between features.
# Titanic Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Project Overview
This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset to uncover patterns
and insights related to passenger survival during the Titanic disaster.

Objectives
- Understand the structure and quality of the dataset
- Identify and handle missing values
- Analyze survival trends by gender, class, age, and fare
- Detect outliers and correlations between features
- Visualize insights using charts and heatmaps

Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- SciPy

Key Insights
- Female passengers had a significantly higher survival rate than males
- First-class passengers had better survival chances
- Higher fare showed a positive correlation with survival
- Several valid fare outliers were identified

Files Included
- `eda_titanic.py` – Python source code
- `titanic.csv` – Dataset
- `Titanic_EDA_Project_Report.pdf` – Detailed project report

## ✅ Conclusion
EDA plays a crucial role in understanding data before applying machine learning models.
This project demonstrates how structured analysis and visualization can lead to meaningful insights.
